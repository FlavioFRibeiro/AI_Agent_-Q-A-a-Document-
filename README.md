## Getting Started 
### Running the Example

Execute the files in order to build and query the document database:

1. Create embeddings and store in LanceDB: `python 3-embedding.py`
2. Test basic search functionality: `python 4-search.py`
3. Launch the Streamlit chat interface: `streamlit run 5-chat.py`

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the document Q&A interface.

### Processing Pipeline

The standard pipeline includes:

1. Document parsing with format-specific backend
2. Layout analysis using AI models
3. Table structure recognition
4. Metadata extraction
5. Content organization and structuring
6. Export formatting

## Models

Docling leverages two primary specialized AI models for document understanding. At its core, the layout analysis model is built on the `RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformer)` architecture, which excels at detecting and classifying page elements. This model processes pages at 72 dpi resolution and can analyze a single page in under a second on a standard CPU, having been trained on the comprehensive `DocLayNet` dataset.

The second key model is `TableFormer`, a table structure recognition system that can handle complex table layouts including partial borders, empty cells, spanning cells, and hierarchical headers. TableFormer typically processes tables in 2-6 seconds on CPU, making it efficient for practical use. 

For documents requiring text extraction from images, Docling integrates `EasyOCR` as an optional component, which operates at 216 dpi for optimal quality but requires about 30 seconds per page. Both the layout analysis and TableFormer models were developed by IBM Research and are publicly available as pre-trained weights on Hugging Face under "ds4sd/docling-models".

For more detailed information about these models and their implementation, you can refer to the [technical documentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09869).

## Chunking

When you're building a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application, you need to break down documents into smaller, meaningful pieces that can be easily searched and retrieved. But this isn't as simple as just splitting text every X words or characters.

What makes [Docling's chunking](https://ds4sd.github.io/docling/concepts/chunking/) unique is that it understands the actual structure of your document. It has two main approaches:

1. The [Hierarchical Chunker](https://ds4sd.github.io/docling/concepts/chunking/#hierarchical-chunker) is like a smart document analyzer - it knows where the natural "joints" of your document are. Instead of blindly cutting text into fixed-size pieces, it recognizes and preserves important elements like sections, paragraphs, tables, and lists. It maintains the relationship between headers and their content, and keeps related items together (like items in a list).

2. The [Hybrid Chunker](https://ds4sd.github.io/docling/concepts/chunking/#hybrid-chunker) takes this a step further. It starts with the hierarchical chunks but then:
   - It can split chunks that are too large for your embedding model
   - It can stitch together chunks that are too small
   - It works with your specific tokenizer, so the chunks will fit perfectly with your chosen language model

### Why is this great for RAG applications?

Imagine you're building a system to answer questions about technical documents. With basic chunking (like splitting every 500 words), you might cut right through the middle of a table, or separate a header from its content. But Docling's smart chunking:

- Keeps related information together
- Preserves document structure
- Maintains context (like headers and captions)
- Creates chunks that are optimized for your specific embedding model
- Ensures each chunk is meaningful and self-contained

This means when your RAG system retrieves chunks, they'll have the proper context and structure, leading to more accurate and coherent responses from your language model.
